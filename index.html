    <h2>A bit about me</h2>

    <p>I will assume you know my name. Online, I go by the moniker of Dipscom. If you've seen it in some old IRC channel or forum, it's likely that it was me.</p>

    <p>I work as a freelance font-end developer based in the South East of England. I like to dabble with anything and everything in the front-end: Static HTML and CSS with beautiful typography; animated pages and SVGs; working with JavaScript; 3D and audio; publishing. Really, all of it. And then, some more.</p>

    <p>The web is a great place. it should be accesible, semantic and we should use the right tool for the right job.</p>

    <p>Besides this website, I have a <a href="https://twitter.com/dipscom">Twitter account</a> to keep abrest of what's going on and to chat with people, a <a href="https://codepen.io/dipscom/">CodePen account</a> for small-scale experiments and a <a href="https://github.com/dipscom">GitHub account</a> for bigger experiments and work.</p>

    <h2>A bit about this website</h2>

    <p>I don't blog (although I keep telling myself I should write a little personal journal as to remember things I did when I grow old). I don't speak at conferences (although I have given talks at meetups a couple of times). I don't create tutorials (I should, if only to document things I will need to remember in the future). I'm not a designer. Nor I am too good with words. Almost all designs you see here were taken or, at the very least, inspired by someone else's work.</p>

    <p>With such lack of creative powers I end up with nothing to show of my skills. To remediate that, I thought it would be neat if I just made a bunch of versions of my own site, much in the same vein as <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> with the twist that is to showcase all my different skills, not just CSS.</p>
